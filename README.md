# California Plates FULL (v4)
Embossed California plates replacing ALL GTA plates. Includes clean styles and stickered variants
with years randomized (2020–2040) at build time.

This resource replaces ALL GTA V license plates with **California plates** (NPC + player vehicles).
No .ytd editing needed — it's fully drag-and-drop.

## Install
1) Drop `caliplates_full` into `resources`
2) Add `ensure caliplates_full` to server.cfg
3) Restart the server

## Stickered Variants
(appear in extra plate slots – fully DMV-accurate, crisp/new stickers, randomized months + even year distribution 2020–2040)

plate07 → California Standard White w/ stickers
plate08 → California Sunset w/ stickers
plate09 → California Legacy Blue w/ stickers

## Notes
- vMenu/custom plate text still works (this only changes the background textures).
GTA randomly cycles plate styles on vehicles. vMenu and custom car spawns will also pull from these slots.
If you only want certain plates available, you can restrict access via your server’s configs.
